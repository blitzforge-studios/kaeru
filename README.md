# Kaeru Legacy (Archived)

> Kaeru Legacy is an archived JavaScript Discord bot project. It is no longer maintained and kept only for historical reference.

## Overview

Kaeru Legacy was our original Discord bot built in vanilla JavaScript, featuring unique moderation and interaction tools tailored for our community. It served as a foundation and learning experience before we transitioned to a more modern TypeScript-based codebase.

## Why archived?

- Outdated technology stack and architecture  
- Replaced by a new TypeScript rewrite with better scalability and maintainability  
- No further updates or support will be provided  

## Technical Details

2. Run `npm install`  
3. Add your Discord bot token and config to `.env`  
4. Run with `node index.js`
