        <p>
            When you create an account with us, you must provide us information
            that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do
            so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate
            termination of your account on our Service.

        <h2>Links To Other Web Sites</h2>
        <p>
            Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services
            that are not owned or controlled by Kaeru.
        </p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>
            We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately,
            without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever,
            including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
            laws of Turkey, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace
            these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to
            provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking
            effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our
            sole discretion.
